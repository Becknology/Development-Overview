Slack is our main form of communications. Here are some Slack basics: 
 * Keep messages public. Public messages are better than private. 
 * Keep messages in relevant channel
 * To add a channel, on the left window in Slack find **channel +** and add yourself to relevent channels: #development, #android, #nodejs-api, etc..

## Your first contribution
* Find a task you would like to work on by: 
  * 1. browse the issues in individual repositories 
  * 2. make a message in the relevant slack channel
  * 3. contact @Zaven on relevant slack
* Fork the repository
* Make a pull request
* Ask for clarification if needed (via Git hub issues or slack)

Think Agile.  When it doubt ask.
