# Welcome to GreenStand's Tree Tracker project

## Contributing

To learn more about how to contribute see [Contributing](https://github.com/Greenstand/Development-Overview/blob/master/Contributing.md) 

Currently each repository has open issues associated with it.  We are currently working to consolidate these issue trackers for a bird's eye view of project status and development needs.  Find us on Slack for further details.  We are currently experimenting with using ZenHub to consolidate tickets, feel free to install the [ZenHub Plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/zenhub-for-github/ogcgkffhplmphkaahpmffcafajaocjbd?hl=en-US)
