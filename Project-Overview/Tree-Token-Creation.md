# Tree Token Creation
 
## Core principle: 
- A value system derived from the physical act of verifying tree survival.
- A value system that rewards people responsible for tree survival.

## Core ideas: 
- The token has a market-driven value. 
- All tokens are backed by tree verification(s). 
- One can own fractions of tree impact with tokens.
- Greenstand sets and maintains a tree validation standard.
- Validated trees on Greenstand platform produce tokens that are assigned to a user's digital wallet.
- Tokens can be bought, sold, and traded (token economics) independent of Greenstand.
- The network of reforestation organizations and their respective community of supporters would determine the monitary value of tokens.   

# Tree Token Value at Creation

## Current system 
- 1 token = one tree verification (Geotagged time-stamped image of a tree).
~- Creation Limit = 1 per tree per 28 days cycle.~

Greenstand is paying tree planters in local currency per token 

### Current Shortcomings 
This system doesn't account for:
- Environmental Challenges
- Special trees
- Species diversity
- Delays in tracking

For example, Sarah tracks their Baobab tree once every 3 months and receives one token each time they track at 3.5 cents for an awesome tree that is challenging to keep alive. 


### Value Factor (Troken)
An algorithm that adds a relative value factor to individual tree captures *# Trokens = Token * Value Factors.*

Value Factor compensates for:
  - unique environmental challenges
  - Species diversity
  - Unique Species 
  - Other ecological value
  - actual tree growth
  - Other challanges

### Flagged tokens
 Invalid trees (dead trees, duplicates, miss-matched) are flagged and possibly removed from the system
 They can be credited to the buyer's account and planters 'account payable' is debited.

### Possible Solution to Token Ownership Issues:

~#### Seed Tokens and Filler tokens~

~### Seed Token:~
~An update verification of a tree that verifies interim tokens.~
 
~#### Filler Tokens:~
~An interim token fabricated by a lapse in two seed tokens.~  
~Filler Tokens:~
  ~- Have a reduction factor of 'x' to incentivize tracking~
  ~- Can not be fabricated by two separate planters~
  ~- Can not be generated 'x' months after a Seed Token~
  ~- Must link to corresponding Seed Token Verification updates~
~Number of tokens = months since last verification of that tree?~
